Splice Chat is a chat application designed for personal use and developed with modern technologies. It allows you to connect with your friends and family in a simple and convenient way. The application has been created using the following technologies:

- **Front-end**: Developed in React JS, Splice Chat offers a fluid and responsive user experience in the UI. This allows a smooth navigation and intuitive interaction.

- **Back-end**: The Splice Chat backend is built with Node.js and uses the Socket.io library to enable real-time communication between users. This ensures that messages are delivered instantly and enables a live chat experience.

- **Database**: User information and messages are efficiently stored in MongoDB. This ensures data persistence and allows easy access to past conversations.
